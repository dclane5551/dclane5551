Hi! My name is Danny, and I'm in school for Full-Stack Web Development. I've been very much enjoying learning html, and seeing my website improve real time is quite satisfying. I aspire to either freelance or work under a respected company after graduation, whichever is the more efficient option at the time. 

</br> Some facts about myself: </br>
<ul>
  <li>I love gaming, and have played at a high level in many FPS and TPS games. I also am a big fan of rhythm games.</li>
  <li>I am very invested in the gym, and I would love to compete in a bodybuilding show at some point in my life.</li>
  <li>I currently live in Connecticut, but have lived in Florida for about 3 years at one point.</li>
</ul>
